        "name": "Why Do Babies Vomit?",
        "content": "The most common reason why babies vomit in the early weeks after birth is that is some of the milk is being brought up with some air when baby burps.\nThe other reason why babies vomit often is that the muscle valve at the top of their stomach that opens into the stomach is weak and immature. In adults, this valve closes tightly after swallowing food, to keep food down. It requires much force to push this valve open to allow an adult to vomit. The lid does not close tightly enough in babies. So, a little force can make the valve open, and milk will come out.\nBaby may also vomit if the baby's stomach is 'overfull,' or is gently pressed on. For example, if you rest the baby too far over your shoulder, or if you bend over your baby with the baby on your laps.\nVomiting will improve as the baby grow older from about 6 months to 1 year. It will also improve when the baby starts to sit down and to spend more time sitting down and to spend more time sitting.",

        "content": "Do not force the child to take the new food. The baby is used to breastmilk, so if the child takes 1 or 2 spoons of the food at each attempt, it is ok. The baby will increase the quantity he takes gradually. Try to be patient and be playful when introducing the food. It will make the baby have an interest in the food.  Keep in mind that you should give only one food at a time. Give the same food for at least 3-4 days before you give another one. Also, do not add many ingredients at once. For example, give only pap first for 3-4 days. Then add milk and give for 3-4 days. Continue to give breastmilk till the baby is at least 1 year old.\na) Pap- pap made from grounded fermented Maize, guinea corn, and soya beans is very simple and easy to make. You can give it with a spoon or make it watery to serve with feeding bottle. This is often the first weaning food that most mothers give their babies.\nb) Vegetables and tubers: Well-mashed cooked vegetables are good. You can use the common vegetables and tubers you prepare for the family, like yam, sweet potato, Irish potato, carrots, cassava, and examples of vegetables are dark green leafy plants, tomatoes, etc.\nc) Fruit: Mashed banana is very good. Remove the seed from orange and juice it for the baby. Peel the back of apples, remove the seeds and mash it. Make juice from or mash mango, pawpaw and give to the baby.\n d) Beans â€“ peel the back of beans and cook it with little salt and pepper till it is soft. Give to the baby. Give Moimoi and Akara.\n e)Grains and Cereals: Rice is one of the most popular weaning foods. Just make sure it is soft. You can leave other grains like oats or corn until a few months later (wheat, millet, sorghum).\nf)Swallows: Amala with Ewedu is a common weaning food for babies in western Nigeria. Add ground crayfish or boiled fish to the soup. It will make the soup a nutritious meal for the baby. As the baby grows older, you give other swallows like Eba, Semovita, Pounded Yam because the baby can digest them. However, ensure that the food is soft enough for your child to eat.\n g)Animal product:  Give animal products such as milk, eggs, cheese, yogurt, fish, chicken and meat.",

There is less room for food. The best way to cope is to eat something, even a small snack, every 3 to 4 hours. Don't drink water or juice with a meal. This is because liquid fills your stomach quickly, leaving less room for solid food. \nb)Constipation- Constipation is common among women in the first trimester and the final months of pregnancy. Take more fluid, fruits, and vegetables to help you pass feces easily.\nc)Edema- Sometimes extra water accumulates in your body. This can lead to swelling on your legs and feet. To reduce this symptom, take less or remove salt from your food, place your feet on a stool when you want to sit down for long.\nd) Shortness of Breath/Fatigue- During the last three months of pregnancy, you will be carrying a heavy load because of the increase in growth of the fetus. Your expanding uterus puts pressure on the respiratory system and leads to shortness of breath and tiredness. Sometimes you may not be able to sleep well because you are feeling uncomfortable. When you do not have enough sleep, it can lead to fatigue.\ne) Indigestion and Heartburn- The growing fetus will put pressure on the digestive tract and cause some of the things in the stomach to go back up into the throat. This causes heartburn. To reduce heartburn, eat small meals at regular intervals, chew your food thoroughly and eat slowly. Do not lie down immediately after eating. \nf)High Blood Pressure- when Edema is serious it can be a sign of pre-eclampsia which causes high blood pressure. Sometimes there is hypertension caused by pregnancy. The high blood pressure can hinder blood flow to the placenta and deprive the fetus oxygen and nutrients. If you have hypertension you need to get more rest, do not stand for long and if you want to sit for long put your feet on a small stool or pillow.\ng)Urinary Tract Infections- Urinary Tract infections are common during pregnancy. During the last trimester it may lead to kidney infection if it not properly treated. Kidney infection can cause forced labor.",

This pain is common in the second trimester and is harmless. \nb)Gas and Constipation: Gas during pregnancy is caused by high levels of a hormone.  The more this hormone is released, your intestine's work slows down, and it makes food travel more slowly. To reduce the number of time that this pain happens, drink plenty of water, eat foods rich in fiber and exercise.\nc)Practice contractions: Practice contraction is not dangerous to you and your baby. Many women report that this contraction feels like a tightening of the stomach muscles so that stomach feels firm or hard. It feels like real labor contraction. It is important to know the difference between practice contractions from true contractions. The real contraction will be closer together, last for a longer period, and are painful. True contractions will take your breath away and disturb your normal activities. However, practice contraction will allow you to carry on your normal activities. Also, doctors report that this can be caused by dehydration, so drinking plenty of water can help eliminate this problem. \nd)General Discomforts: It is common for pregnant women to have discomfort due to growing uterus, sensitivities to foods and changing body.",

A symptom of placental abruption is constant pain that causes the stomach to stay hard for a long period without relief. Another sign is the flow of bloody fluid or premature breakage of water. Also, there may be tenderness in the stomach, back pain, or fluid discharge with blood. \nc)Miscarriage: It is the most common form of pregnancy loss. A miscarriage often happens in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy. Signs of a miscarriage include mild to severe back pain, true contractions (happening every 5-20 minutes), tissue or clot-like material passing from the vagina, brown or bright red bleeding with or without cramps, and a sudden decrease in other signs of pregnancy. \nd)Urinary Tract Infection: Urinary Tract Infection can be easily treated during pregnancy but if it is ignored it can cause complications.

If you have this problem, speak to your health provider. Some factors cause delayed breast milk flow. They include;\na)Premature delivery may make the breast not produce enough milk. It is because the pregnancy did not go through the whole process of development hence the body does not that time to prepare the breast for milk production.\nb)Very stressful birth such as long labor, long pushing stage, cesarean section or use of forceps can cause a delay in breast milk flow.\nc)Damage in nerves connected to milk flow or shift in the bones of the spine.\nd)A large number of drips used during delivery can accumulate in the breast and delay the production of milk. \ne)Retained part of the placenta can cause the milk production to delay because the hormone called progesterone will remain high. It is when progesterone reduces that milk production will start.\nf)Losing much blood may damage a part of the brain that controls breast milk. \ng)Delivery of heavy babies at the first birth may delay of milk production.\nh)The pain relief given during childbirth can cause a delay in breast milk flow.\ni)Separation of the baby from its mother for long may lead to a delay in breast milk flow.

The color of the blood may be bright red, and it may start and stop, then restart after several days or weeks. Sudden and much bleeding may occur in the third trimester of pregnancy. The bleeding does not usually come with pain. There may be pain during bleeding in some women. In 7% to 30% of women who have placenta previa, there may be no bleeding at all. The bleeding happens because as the pregnancy is growing, the placenta removes from the walls of the womb. In the third trimester, the walls of the womb become thinner and spread to give room to the growing fetus. If placenta previa is present, the placenta is attached very low on the womb wall. This thinning of the walls of the womb makes the placenta stretch and tear away from the wall of the womb, leading to bleeding. The possible complications of placenta previa: \na)Infection and formation of blood clots \nb)Unborn baby has pain due to low oxygen supply\nc)Slow growth of the baby due to insufficient blood supply \nd)Shock and death of the mother if the bleeding is too much\ne)Baby may have anemia",

        "name": "Traditional Pregnancy Prevention Methods",
        "content": "\na)Exclusive Breastfeeding Method â€“ is a temporary natural pregnancy prevention method for women who just delivered babies and the monthly menstrual period has not started again. It works when a mother breastfeeds the baby that is less than 6 months old day and night without giving the baby any other food. It prevents the eggs to be released into the womb. It would prevent pregnancy up to 99% if it used correctly and continuously. Note it that does not work for every woman, and it tends to depend on your heredity of the trait. \nb)Calendar method- it uses the calendar to calculate the days when the woman is fertile. It prevents pregnancy for up to 91%. The day that women starts to menstruate is Day 1. You will count to Day 12 after the menstruation and up to Day 16 after the menses. The Day 12 to Day 16 after menstruation is the days when the woman can get pregnant if she has sex without prevention. This means that the total number of days that the woman can get pregnant is 5 days each month.  The way you arrive at the 5 days is that a woman's egg will come into her womb the 14th after her menstruation starts. So, she can get pregnant that day. The egg will live for 2 days that means she can get pregnant 2 days after her egg comes into the womb. Then if you add that 2 days to the 14th day you will get the 16th day. However, a male sperm will live for 2 days in the womb before it dies. It means that if a woman has sex without prevention 2 days before her eggs come, then she can still get pregnant. So, you remove 2 days from the 14th day after menstruation you will get the 12th day.  Note that to calculate it, the date in the calendar is not what you are counting. It is the day. Hence for example, if your menstruation starts on Monday, July 23, 2018, you will count that Monday as Day 1, and you will count it until you get Day 12 which is Friday, August 3, 2018. Then you will continue to the 16th Day which is Tuesday, August 6, 2018. Therefore, from Friday, August 3 to Tuesday, August 6, 2018, you must prevent yourself from getting pregnant. Please note that the calculation is the same for every woman even if your menstrual cycle is 25 day or 32 days. But it does not work well for women with menstruation that is not regular. \nc)Removal Method- the man removes his penis from the vagina and release the sperm outside away from the woman's vagina. It prevents fertilization up to 96%. Note that it is not easy for the man to always know when to remove the penis on time. It can make the man to release inside the vagina.",

This is because after they are digested, their breakdown products are carried in the blood to the lungs where they can affect the breath.\nc)  Dry mouth: the mouth is cleaned naturally by Saliva. If the mouth is dry, mouth odor can build up.\nd)  Dental hygiene: Brushing and flossing ensure the removal of small particles of food that can build up and slowly break down, producing odor. A film of bacteria called plaque builds up if brushing is not regular. This plaque can irritate the gums and cause swelling between the teeth and gums. Dentures that are not cleaned regularly or properly can also harbor bacteria that cause halitosis.\ne)  Crash diets: Fasting and eating low-carbohydrate can produce bad mouth odor. This is because the body will be breaking down fats. This process produces a chemical product that has a strong aroma.\nf)  Drugs: Some medications can reduce saliva and, therefore, increase mouth odor. Other drugs can produce odors as they break down and release chemicals in the breath. People who take vitamin supplements in large doses can be prone to bad mouth odor.\ng)  Mouth, nose, and throat infections: Sometimes bacteria-covered stones can form on the tonsils at the back of the throat and produce odor. Also, infections or inflammation in the nose, throat, or sinuses can cause mouth odor.\nh)  Foreign body: Bad odor can be caused by something in the nasal cavity, especially in children.\ni)  Diseases: Some diseases such as cancers, liver failure, and other metabolic diseases can cause bad odor because of some chemicals that they produce.",
